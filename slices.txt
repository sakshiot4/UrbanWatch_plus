Great question! Let me outline all the **remaining slices** we need to complete UrbanWatch+ as a fully functional civic engagement platform.

***

## **REMAINING SLICES (After Complaint Module)**

***

### **SLICE 2: Officer Assignment & Management**
**What:** Officers view, assign themselves to complaints, and manage complaint lifecycle.

## **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) = Slices 1-6**

With Slices 1-6, you have a **fully functional civic complaint system** ready for real-world use.

**Which slice do you want to tackle next?** I recommend continuing with **Slice 2: Officer Assignment** since we were just about to start it!
